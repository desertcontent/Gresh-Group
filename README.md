Greshgroup Responsive Site -
This site was based on a simple Bootstrap 3 framework and modified to incorporate some content and features from the original greshgroup.com site.

The 'walkon' flash video had to be incorporated and include different formats to fit into the new responsive design and to be compatible with mobile devices.  The design allowed for simple user control versus being enabled after hitting the homepage. The user originally sees a static portrait image with the option of playing the introductory video when they arrive at the meet.html page. Upon completion of the video the original portrait is swapped back in. This was accomplished via two Javascript utilizing jQuery for the animation in the meet.html file. 

The other features of the site were mainly created via Bootstrap 3. The images, including backgrounds were a combination a Photoshop reworked stock photos that I selected with client approval and some limited images from the original site.

A fairly simple site, but my first venture into Bootstrap and some Flash reworking that I haven’t used for some time. The primary concern of this project was getting the smart phone look and user experience looking solid. Most client’s and prospects of the Gresh Group were accessing the site from referrals in a very mobile political/business atmosphere.
